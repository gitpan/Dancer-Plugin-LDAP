NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::LDAP - LDAP plugin for Dancer micro framework

VERSION
    Version 0.0010

SYNOPSIS
        use Dancer;
        use Dancer::Plugin::LDAP;

        # Calling the ldap keyword returns you a LDAP handle
        $ldap = ldap;

        # Use convenience methods for retrieving, updating and deleting LDAP entries
        $account = ldap->quick_select({dn => 'uid=racke@linuxia.de,dc=linuxia,dc=de'});

        ldap->quick_update('uid=racke@linuxia.de,dc=linuxia,dc=de', {l => 'Vienna'});

        ldap->quick_delete('uid=racke@linuxia.de,dc=linuxia,dc=de');

DESCRIPTION
    Provides an easy way to obtain a connected LDAP handle by simply calling
    the ldap keyword within your Dancer application.

    Returns a Dancer::Plugin::LDAP::Handle object, which is a subclass of a
    Net::LDAP handle object, so it does everything you'd expect to do with
    Net::LDAP, but also adds a few convenience methods. See the
    documentation for Dancer::Plugin::LDAP::Handle for full details of
    those.

  TEXT SEARCHES
    Need to run a text search across your LDAP directory? This plugin
    provides a quick way to do that:

        for (qw/uid sn givenName c l/) {
            $search{$_} = [substr => $args{search}];
        }

        @entries = ldap->quick_select({-or => \%search});

  UTF-8
    Attribute values returned by the Dancer::Plugin::LDAP::Handle method are
    automatically converted to UTF-8 strings.

CONFIGURATION
        plugins:
            LDAP:
